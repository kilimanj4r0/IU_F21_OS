Let's onsider a sequences: 
1) 7 7 7 7
2) 7 8 9 10
hit/miss ratio: 1) 3/1 = 3.0; 2) 0/4 = 0.0

So it means that we can get:
The best ratio when all references will be equal to each other.
In the general case for n references we have n-1 hit/miss ratio (since the page frames are empty initially the first reference entry will result in miss).

The worst ratio when all references will be distinct.
In the general case for n distinct references we have 0.0 hit/miss ratio (since any of references are not equal the every reference entry will result in miss).

Therefore, to increase the ratio we should tend to use as much same page references as we can.
To decrease the ratio we should tend to not repeat the page reference entries.
