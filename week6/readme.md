The outputs shows that:
- FCFS has the worst performance
- SJF has intermediate performance
- Round-robin has the best performance

**SJF is more effective than FCFS** because it takes the shortest job first to decrease average WT and as a consequence average TAT

**Round-robin is the most effective** because each process gets an equal amount of the CPU resource, hence average WT and as a consequence average TAT can be decreased even more depending on quantum factor chosen by user
