A physical address is simply the address of some data that is stored in the physical RAM chips.
For example, we can access some data (e.g. variable) at address 0x3b21ba.

A virtual address is the address (usually not real) that stored in page table and corresponds (translates via MMU) to the physical address.
The programs usually use it, while the CPU used it to fetch the data. The size of virtual address depends on the system.
