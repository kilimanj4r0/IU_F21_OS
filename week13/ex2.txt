Recovery
Useful when we care about the performance.
It is not advisable to break any deadlock condition, better to recover the deadlock.

Prevention
Useful when we prefer the stability and safety over the performance.
It is possible to neglect one of the four deadlock conditions instead of handle deadlock and recover them.

Avoidance
Useful when the deadlocks are not preferred, but we still care about the performance.
We also have no intention to break some deadlock condtions.
